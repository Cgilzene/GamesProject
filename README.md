Game project 
A Simple Math Game for kids: 

## How to play: 
Press the Start button and add the eyes of the aliens together that appear on the screen to match the target value. Once the aliens are selected press the check button to determine if your answer is correct or not. For every answer you get correct you are awarded a point. Be quick though as you only have 1 minute to complete the game. 

## Inspiration for the game: 
The aim of this simple math game is to encourage learning outside of the classroom, sharpening their strategic skills as well as numerical independenceâ€¦this game provides a fun and interactive way to do both. 

## What was learned during this project:
Using the Sprint methodology to create this game in a space of three days was both fun and challenging especially for someone new to c#. This projected provided me with the platform to practice basic concepts such as:
* Declaring Variable, 
* Creating classes, 
* Using Methods,
* Data type conversion,
* Working with if statements,
* Basic Arithmetic functions, 
* Working with Windows Presentation Foundation,
* Using Switch Statements,
* Using Test Driven Development,
* Using SQL localdb to store user info

## Difficulties faced: 
As with any project difficulties will arise here are a few challenges id faced: 
*	Assigning each individual image a number that correlated to the eyes on the image.
*	Solution: Using the tag element in the WPF to keep track of the images.
*	Adding the values from different buttons using the same Onclick event handler
*	Solution: Making the variable public and when a number is pressed updating the variable

## Improvements to be made:
* Creating a slightly more up to date user interface
* Adding another window to view the high scores
* Create more input fields to add more specific user data
* Find a more efficient way of adding images to buttons
* Using more appropriate images
* Create a start up screen explaining the functions of the game
