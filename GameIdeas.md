A Simple Math Game for kids: 
How to play: 
Press the Start button and add the eyes of the aliens together that appear on the screen to match the target value. Once the aliens are selected press the check button to determine if your answer is correct or not. For every answer you get correct you are awarded a point. Be quick though as you only have 1 minute to complete the game. 

Inspiration for the game: 
The aim of this simple math game is to encourage learning outside of the classroom, sharpening their strategic skills as well as numerical independence…this game provides a fun and interactive way to do both. 

What was learned during this project:
Using the Sprint methodology to create this game in a space of three days was both fun and challenging especially for someone new to c#. This projected provided me with the platform to practice basic concepts such as:
Declaring Variable, 
Creating classes, 
Using Methods,
Data type conversion,
Working with if statements,
Basic Arithmetic functions, 
Working with Windows Presentation Foundation,
Using Switch Statements,
Using Test Driven Development,
Using SQL localdb to store info

Difficulties faced: 
As with any project difficulties will arise here are a few challenges id faced: 
•	Assigning each individual image a number that correlated to the eyes on the image.
•	Solution: Using the tag element in the WPF to keep track of the images.
•	Adding the values from different buttons using the same Onclick event handler
•	Solution: Making the variable public and when a number is pressed updating the variable

Improvements to be made:
Creating a slightly more up to date user interface
Adding another window to view the high scores
Create more input fields to add more specific user data
Find a more efficient way of adding images to buttons
Using more appropriate images
Create a start up screen explaining the functions of the game


Game 1:
Shooting Aliens - Math Game

Shoot the aliens that add up to a generated number.

The Aim:
The aim is to add the values on the screen when the right 
alien pops up to match a random number that is genrated. 

Each alien is assigned a number, the alien appears randomly
on a grid, when the user clicks the correct combination of aliens 
he is awarded a point. The game will have a timer and the score will 
be displayed until beaten by a higher score. 

Aimed Learning objectives: 
Functions
Methods
Loops
Boolean
Arrays/Lists
prints messages/ accepting values

Why the game was chosen: 
I think this is a game that is challenging but just within my knowledge of C#
This will help to me practice a few things that I find to wrap my head around and 
link togehter. 

Day 1:
Project was created
Added images to the WPF window that generate randomly
A timer was implemented 
Experimented with different methods of controlloing images
Start button functional

Day 2: 
Individual images were assigned values
Used a different methods of displaying images using buttons

Day 3:
Game finally functional 
A few bugs to be wored through
Database connection established
